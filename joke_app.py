AI Stand-Up Comedian ðŸŽ¤
This Python program uses Gradio to create a simple web interface that delivers jokes based on user-selected genres. It fetches jokes from the JokeAPI in real time. Users can choose from various categories like Programming, Pun, Dark, Spooky, and more using a dropdown menu. Depending on the joke format returned (single-line or two-part), the program displays it accordingly in a friendly text box.

Features:

Live joke fetching using the JokeAPI.

Multiple categories for different types of humor.

Clean and fun user interface built with Gradio.

Perfect for a quick laugh and a great beginner project for those learning APIs and Python UI development.



# Joke Generator Web App using Gradio and JokeAPI

# Importing essential libraries
import gradio as gr

import time  # Unused but added to simulate potential delay

# Placeholder for future enhancements (currently unused)
